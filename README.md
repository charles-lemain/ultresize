# ultresize

*this is an incomplete (and discontinued) Python utility for adding 
keyboard shortcuts that can resize a window to a specified size using pygetwindow
and a keyboard listener from pynput. Useful for ultrawide monitor users.

It's for windows so I don't currently need it, but it's possible I'll finish this in the future.
