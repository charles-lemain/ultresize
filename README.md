# ultresize

***THIS SCRIPT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS BY A BEGINNER SELF-TAUGHT PROGRAMMER***

This is a tiny utility that provides a hotkey to automatically resize any window to the desired size.
I made it to quickly resize windows to about 2/3 screen width and it is aimed at ultrawide display setups,
to work around the default edge snapping features in Windows 10.

I will be adding new features.
